    The most commonly used public transportation for commuting in South Korea is by far "the subway". When taking the subway, passengers go back and forth to find empty seats. However, it is difficult to find empty seats, and even if it is found, it is often taken away by other passengers.
    <br><br>
    Here, our application provides a service for sharing boarding information of passengers on the same train. Using the public api from data.seoul, users share their arrival station to other users who are currently on board or on the train. By sharing their arrival stations, users can know when and where vacant seats will occur, thereby enabling a more comfortable commuting life.
