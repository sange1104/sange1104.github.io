    Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, online class increases and it is hard for both educators and students to actively interact with each other in class. Specifically, educators are having trouble on getting their students to participate in online class. In other words, it is difficult for educators to determine how much students are concentrating in online classes. 
    <br><br>
    This application tries to capture the students' concentration on online class in real time. By providing the score of concentration, it helps educators gauge what students understand and what students may need educators to review again. In addition, it prompts students to participate in class more by trying to get higher score than their classmates.
