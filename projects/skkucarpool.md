    Since our school is far from the nearby subway station, students have hard time to get to school after arriving at the station. There are three options they can choose: a walk, a shuttle bus, or a taxi. Even though taking a taxi is expensive, some students decide to take a taxi when they are in urgency, such as being late for class. In response, our service starts with the question, "How about matching students who want to take a taxi from the station to school?"
    <br><br>
    This application provides a chat service for users who want to take a taxi to get to school but want to save their money by a shared ride. Up to four of the nearby users will enter one chat room, and then our application offers a simple Dutch Pay service assuming that one student has paid for a taxi.
